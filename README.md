This is the Android_Me project part of the Fragment Exercise in Udacity's Advanced Android Developer course.
origin repo: https://github.com/udacity/Android_Me

This app lets you dress up and customize your own Android just like you would with a Bitmoji.

This app shows how to use Fragments, FragmentManager, Intents, Activities, Master-Detail flow, Multi-pane support,
local image assets data, GridViews, Adapters, and how to retain information in device-orientation changes.
