This app lets you dress up and customize your own Android just like you would with a Bitmoji.

This app shows how to use Fragments, FragmentManager, Intents, Activities, Master-Detail flow, Multi-pane support,
local image assets data, GridViews, Adapters, and how to retain information in device-orientation changes.
